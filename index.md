## Context

Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important in public policies as well as in our daily life. Knowledge of the state of our planet and the assessment of climate impa t impact of human activities require **free and easy access to reliable, accurate, aggregated and documented data**.
While several open data platforms and portals are engaged in publishing relevant environnmental data (air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, natural hazards, energy resources...), the use of this data remain oftne complex and tedious, especially for non-data specialist. Identification and mapping of the different sources as well as cleaning, recoding, normalization, cross-referencing, consolidation and aggregation at different geographic scales is often necessary before being able to use the available data.

To remedy these difficulties, as part of the OpenGeoScales project, we are proposing to build **a centralized access point to standardized and aggregated environmental data at different geographic scales**. In addition to providing reliable and standardized environmental data, OpenGeoScales offers **free access to processing** implemented on raw data collected from various sources and aims to federate **an open source community** participating in the production of data and tools needed to explore them.

## CarbonGeoScales project

Greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions from human activities are considered as the most significant driver of observed climate change since the mid-20th century. In order to better mitigate climate change impacts, policy makers, scientists, carbon and environment consultancy specialists, data journalists and citizens need easy free access to relevant and accurate data on GHGs emissions at various spatial scales.

In accordance with the Paris Agreement, countries are required to submit transparent, comparable and complete reporting of GHGs inventories based on the methodologies developed by the IPCC. In addition to these Top-Down approaches, Bottom-Up methods are being used for completing emissions estimates based on satellite imagery and carbon monitoring stations at different spatial scales. At subnational scales, important efforts and specific protocols are deployed for measuring city emissions since they represent a large percent of energy-related GHGs emissions.

### Pain points

The collected GHGs emissions datasets are shared through multiple open data platforms built by different organisms. However, it remains complex and time consuming to use it and combine it due to different formats, standards, scales, protocols, units, data definitionsâ€¦ 

### Solution

---
The main goal of CarbonGeoScales consists of providing a centralized access point to accurate, harmonized, and aggregated GHGs emissions data at multiple geographical scales. 
---

As an open source and collaborative project, different data processing treatments are accessible in order to inform users on transformation and cleaning and transformation processes implemented on raw collected data. The resulting compiled database is accessible by download and through specific API for querying and integrating aggregated data into potential applications. Resulting harmonized GHGs emissions data are completed with consistent documentation, articles and dashboard for exploring its content.

By facilitating access to GHGs emissions open data, CarbonGeoScales is participating to help policy makers to build more effective emissions reduction strategies at different territorial scales and to track their progress more accurately.
