## Context

Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important in public policies as well as in our daily life. Knowledge of the state of our planet and the assessment of climate impa t impact of human activities require **free and easy access to reliable, accurate, aggregated and documented data**.
While several open data platforms and portals are engaged in publishing relevant environnmental data (air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, natural hazards, energy resources...), the use of this data remain oftne complex and tedious, especially for non-data specialist. Identification and mapping of the different sources as well as cleaning, recoding, normalization, cross-referencing, consolidation and aggregation at different geographic scales is often necessary before being able to use the available data.

To remedy these difficulties, as part of the OpenGeoScales project, we are proposing to build **a centralized access point to standardized and aggregated environmental data at different geographic scales**. In addition to providing reliable and standardized environmental data, OpenGeoScales offers **free access to processing** implemented on raw data collected from various sources and aims to federate **an open source community** participating in the production of data and tools needed to explore them.
